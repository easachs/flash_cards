##  Flash Cards

To run this [Flash Cards](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards) project in your terminal, navigate to the `flash_cards` directory and run

$`ruby flashcard_runner.rb`

which should initiate the round.

If your guess is incorrect, Flash Cards will reveal the correct answer.

To change between available sets of Flash Cards, open `flashcard_runner.rb` in Atom and enter the new filename on line 18 between the quotation marks of `CardGenerator.new`'s argument, i.e. `("new_cards_file_here.txt")`.

This program can adapt to different cards and categories (and different quantities of each), and has been tested with up to 10 cards at a time.

Enjoy!

Warmly,
